        <ul className="iKDfcs">
          <li className="hTaGYD f-size">
            <span >1.</span>Step 1 is to pick (3) numbers from 0–9. For example
            5,3,6 would be your first picked random numbers from given 0–9. To add
            more thrill and substance to the diversion, the numbers are then
            included/added (5 + 3 + 6) and a last number is given. In this example
            it is 14. Now, you only have have to keep one digit of this number,
            that is the last one. In this example, it will be the 4. So your first
            draw would be 5,3,6 *4.
          </li>
          <li className="hTaGYD f-size">
            <span>2.</span>There are also a second set of numbers which is drawn.
            The process is similar just like step 1. The rules for picking 2nd
            number is exactly same as the first draw. As an random case, lets
            accept the numbers 8,2,8. This gives us a sum of 18, we again just
            only keep the last digit so our last pick for the second draw of
            numbers is 8,2,8 *8
          </li>
          <li className="hTaGYD f-size">

        <p className='f-size'
        >
          Satta is not currently legal in India, but it is still big business.
          Lotteries have become more attractive online because they combine all
          lotteries on an international level, so those from India can leverage
          their bets by only picking lottery cards where the jackpot is the
          biggest. India has a relatively small lottery jackpot while the US and
          EU countries have jackpots commonly in the 100’s of millions of
          Euros/USD. For other betting games, a large majority of Indians are
          still betting with local bookies, but more are using the internet at
          online casinos and online bookies like Betway for cricket and other
          sports or casino games.

        <p className='f-size'
        >
          To win at Matka Satta, you have various rate payouts, ranging from 9/1
          to 999/1. You can bet on the chance of all numbers coming up to the
          first, last, or any other type of bet allowed by the Matka gambling
          bookie. For this reason, it can be an attractive game because of the
          payout multiples, but the game is merely a game of chance and therefore
          can not be beaten. It requires luck to win, but many are superstitious
          about their numbers and always play them, just like the lottery games.

        >
          The Satta betting agent should only take a maximum of 5% of your wager
          amount assuming you win. Because the game is all luck and neither the
          agent nor the bettor has an advantage, the bookie should take home 5% on
          every Rupee wagered. Heavy betting on a certain number or combination of
          numbers can be a dangerous scenario. If those numbers come up, it is
          very likely your bookie will vanish because he can’t afford to cover the
          wagers. When the cards and numbers are picked, generally at 9 PM and 12
          at night the winners are declared. This is how a payout would occur.

        <p className='f-size'
        >
          The origins of Indian Matka gambling involve wagering on the daily price
          of cotton according to the Bombay and the New York Cotton Exchange.
          Nowadays, Matka betting, or Satta King, is a popular lottery-style game.
          It involves the selection of random numbers in the hopes of hitting the
          right number combination. The winner becomes the Satta King and they
          earn the bulk of the prize pool. The legendary radha567 is popularly
          known as the Matka King. After his arrest in 1995, he had to discontinue
          his games and now crooks are running the game he loved so much by fixing
          the numbers. A big fall from grace, but his name remains legendary among
          Satta Matka games in Mumbai.

          most of its following. Indians have chosen the faster-paced action of
          online cricket betting or live dealer casinos on their mobile devices.
          IPL betting draws people like nothing else in India and fans wait
          eagerly to place bets on the event.
